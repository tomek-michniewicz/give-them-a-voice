    transcription: `Hi, my name is Josephine and I work in a mine in the south of Congo. I've been working there for five years, and it's not good for our health.

    The mine is dangerous because we work in small tunnels with bad air, and we're around harmful chemicals and metals. We get sick a lot from breathing problems and rashes.
    
    I don't feel well lately, and I'm worried about my health. Do you know where I can go to see a doctor? I don't have much money, and there aren't any public hospitals close by. I need to take care of myself so I can keep working and provide for my family. If you can help, I'd really appreciate it.`,

    transcription: `My name is Esther and I work in a mine in Congo. I have two kids and I work in the mine to earn money for them. The work is tiring and dangerous. We work for a long time in small tunnels without protection. I worry about getting hurt, but I need to work to take care of my children.

    I heard there are groups that can help women like me who work in the mine. Can you tell me where to find them? I want to take care of my kids without putting myself in danger every day. If you know anything, please let me know. Thank you.`,

    transcription: `Hello, my name is Amina, and I live in a village near a mine in Congo. The mine is owned by a big company, and they have been polluting our water and air for years. Our crops are dying, and many of us are getting sick.

    We have tried talking to the local government officials about the problem, but they haven't done anything to help us. We want to write a letter to the government to complain about the pollution and ask them to do something. Do you know how we can write a letter to the government officials? We don't have much education, and we don't know where to start.
    
    We need help to make our voices heard. We want to protect our health and the environment for our children and grandchildren. Any information or guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.`,
